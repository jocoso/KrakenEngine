# Kraken


Kraken is the marriage of tabletop and text-adventure games. 

Kraken as a software looks to create a way to:

- Allow GM to write their campaigns and test them before playing them with others 
- Teach new people who want to play the game but do not know how to.
- It is perfect for people who wants to play a tabletop game but does not have people to play. 
- Want to write their own creative stories and roleplay as the main character.
- Wants to test and write game lore and mechanics prototypes before creating using a game engine.
